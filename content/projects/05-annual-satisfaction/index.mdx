<Section heading="Satisfaction Survey">
We employed a survey-based research method to understand user satisfaction with various functional modules of the app, targeting users across different educational stages, including elementary, middle, high school, and adult learners.

### Questionnaire Screening and Validation Process

• After a three-step screening process, 2,266 valid questionnaires were obtained, resulting in a valid questionnaire rate of 94.1%.

• Questionnaire reliability 0.887 > 0.8; Questionnaire validity 0.912 > 0.9

• The first step of screening involved collecting a total of 2,409 questionnaires, excluding 2 test questionnaires and 4 questionnaires with uncertain user education stages, leaving 2,403 questionnaires.

• In the second step, 112 questionnaires with overly short (less than 60 seconds) or overly long (more than 10 minutes) answering times were excluded, leaving 2,291 questionnaires.

• The third step involved excluding 25 questionnaires in which more than 8 out of 13 satisfaction questions were answered with 'Unfamiliar, never used,' leaving 2,266 valid questionnaires.

### Satisfaction Analysis

• The user satisfaction score for the app was 4.10, representing an 8.07% decrease from the previous year. 

• The assessment of the Payment Process and Study Materials Access is high, while Course Details, Coin Rewards, and Rewards Store Items need improvement.

### Descriptive Statistical Analysis

### Principal Component Analysis

• The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed, with a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test result of 0.912 indicating its suitability for analysis.

• Based on the importance and satisfaction levels, we categorize the features needing urgent improvement, which are Course Details, Coin Rewards, Rewards Store Items, Course Selection Process, and Study Report Content. The secondary priority for improvement is the Study Materials Access.

### Priority Matrix

• We also broke down the priority matrix by educational level, pinpointing the aspects that require the most improvement for elementary, middle, high school, and adult learners.

<Section heading="Summary & Suggestions">
### Summary

• The Classroom app's user satisfaction score this year is 4.10, with high ratings for the Payment Process and Study Materials Access. However, compared to last year, there's been a noticeable decrease in satisfaction for most areas, particularly Rewards Store Items and Coin Rewards. Furthermore, there's a clear need for improvement in Course Details, Course Selection Process, Study Reports, and Live Interaction Tools.

### Suggestions

• **For Coin Rewards and Rewards Store Items:** simplifying coin distribution, increasing coin amounts, expanding cash product options, and offering more high-quality, practical goods are recommended.

• **For the Course Selection Process:** grouping similar courses and adopting Xueersi's approach for courses with different teachers can help users choose the right teacher and time more easily.

• **For Course Details:** attracting new users with high-quality trial classes and using Homework Help's presentation style can emphasize the difference between trial and regular classes.

• **For Study Reports:** tailoring content and format to the preferences of users from different educational levels is suggested.

• **For Live Interaction Tools:** designing interfaces for various devices like computers, iPads, and phones, and integrating familiar gesture controls for volume and brightness adjustments are recommended.

<Section heading="Personal Reflections">
• Leading this user satisfaction research project during my internship was a significant learning experience. It allowed me to delve into quantitative data analysis and gather qualitative feedback from users, providing a comprehensive view of their satisfaction with the app. 

• This project was instrumental in applying statistical data analysis to UX research. It enhanced my skills in making data-driven recommendations for improving user experiences.
