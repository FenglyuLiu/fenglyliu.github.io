  <Section heading="💡 Motivation">
  After the launch of the Referral Program 2.0, we noticed that the overall conversion rate was only 0.3%, which was significantly lower than expected.

  Research is necessary to grasp user engagement, encompassing motives for sharing, contexts in which sharing occurs, and methods of sharing. This information will be instrumental in guiding subsequent product enhancements.

<Section heading="Research Methods">
**Research Groups:** Elementary, junior and high school camp/experience class/regular price class users, mainly parents

<Section heading="Log Analysis">
### Overall Conversion Rate

The overall conversion rate is 0.78%, the proportion of users from exposure to sharing is too low, which leads to a low overall conversion rate. Therefore, the subsequent improvement process can focus on the process of sharing from exposure to enhance the user sharing rate.

<RichImage src="/projects/referral-research/conversion-funnel.png" alt="Referral program conversion funnel" caption="Overall conversion funnel showing 0.78% conversion rate from exposure to sharing" />

### Conversion Rate by Division (Elementary, Middle, and High School)

- **Elementary school:** highest exposure, highest sharing success rate, lowest invitation success rate; need to explore the motivation for sharing, analyze the reasons for the low invitation success rate
- **Middle School:** lowest exposure, lowest sharing success rate, lowest conversion success rate; need to focus on improving exposure and sharing rate
- **High school:** low sharing success rate, highest invitation success rate, highest conversion success rate, highest overall conversion rate; need to focus on improving the sharing rate

### Conversion Successful User Profile

From the perspective of the school section, the high school section has the highest percentage of successful users, reaching 89.31%.

### New Users vs. Old Users

898 old users successfully invited to 1080 new users, per capita successfully invited 1.2 new users. 

Among the 1080 new users, 988 new users were from the senior high school, accounting for 91.5%. 

Number of new users in the senior high school: first year senior high school > third year senior high school > second year senior high school.

<RichImage src="./new-users.png" alt="New Users" caption=" " />

From the results of the data analysis, improving the sharing rate is very important to improve the overall conversion rate, and the proportion of new users in high school is the largest, so we will focus on the sharing behavior of users in high school in the qualitative analysis.

<Section heading="User Interview">
Through telephone interviews with 11 participants, I learned about the understanding of the high school users of the referral program, their motivations for participating in the program, as well as sorting out their suggestions for the program.

### Interview Findings

- Users generally had some impression of the "Invite for Gift" campaign
- Most users cannot recall the specific program rules
- Most users learned about the program from their teachers
- Users seek a clearer, more straightforward referral program with less promotional and more authentic communication


### What motivates participation/non-participation

<div class="motivation-cards">
  <div class="motivation-card participation">
    <h4>Motivations for participation:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The high quality of the course</li>
      <li>Significant benefits gained by the student</li>
      <li>Recognizing a need for the program in someone else's life</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="motivation-card non-participation">
    <h4>Reasons for non-participation:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of awareness about the program</li>
      <li>Unclear timing details</li>
      <li>Inappropriate timing of the program's promotion, such as right before a lesson, which users found unsuitable</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

The interviews revealed that users seek a clearer, more straightforward referral program with less promotional and more authentic communication. They often shared program details through personal interactions, emphasizing the need for a user-friendly approach. This feedback suggests the importance of focusing on the program's real value and impact, rather than just rewards, to enhance user engagement and participation.

</Section>

<Section heading="Strategic Recommendations">
I read the Fogg Behavior Model and applied its concepts to analyze the referral program. I also learned from competitors' referral programs, forming some suggestions based on their designs. Drawing from these insights and the Fogg Behavior Model, I suggested several improvements.

| Key Area | Improvement Direction | Reason | Specific Recommendations |
|----------|----------------------|--------|-------------------------|
| Improve awareness | Increase program visibility | Low awareness leads to low participation | Enhance teacher communication, improve in-app notifications |
| Simplify sharing process | Reduce friction in sharing | Complex process discourages users | Streamline sharing steps, clarify rules |
| Optimize sharing channels | Focus on preferred channels | Users prefer personal interactions | Enhance WeChat integration, improve sharing UX |
| Enhance incentives | Make rewards more attractive | Discounts are strong motivators | Simplify reward structure, increase value |
| Build trust | Address privacy concerns | Users worry about spam/privacy | Improve privacy messaging, build credibility |

<RichImage src="./strategic-recommendations-table.png" alt="Strategic recommendations table" caption="Key improvement areas and specific recommendations based on Fogg Behavior Model" />

These recommendations were derived from the Fogg Behavior Model framework and competitor analysis insights.

<Section heading="Personal Reflections">
During my internship, I led this user research project, gaining hands-on experience in quantitative data analysis and qualitative interviews. 

This project was my first foray into applying social science and psychology theories in UX research. The experience was invaluable, teaching me how to make informed recommendations for design and operations. 

It reinforced the importance of empathetic UX research in product development, sharpening my analytical skills and deepening my grasp of user-centered design principles.
